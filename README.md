# csv2go_slice

This utility takes a single column csv and transforms it to a go file with a single variable containing a slice of all the strings.

This utility is parametrized so make sure to set the params in main.go according to your needs.
To use, just navigate to the folder using terminal and execute 'go run main.go'.

Built with the help of chatGPT3.5 and my own common sense.
Free to distribute as you please.
